If I then click on Close toolbar window, the program opens anyway. What to do? 2nd question: I have imported (copied) sales files in complete format 81 segments/15f via SD HC card 20 GB class 13 and the process stalls. I have selected NTSC Complete EMV 15f 112:17,X2 (65 segments; 04f) in sequence settings. Is the stalling related to question 1 or is the sequence configuration wrong?       "

473," Dear Ms. Heller, after our telephone conversation on 20.04.2010 at 18:30 I describe you my problem as follows. When publishing the spec sheet with Warehouse ""Webspace Free"" the program told me a ""natien error"". Despite other attempts, this error message persisted.  Since it is not only a simple specification sheet, but also has several tables that are linked together, it was not possible for me to notice this error beforehand due to the amount of work. In addition I had only little experience with Warehouse Specsmanager 9 before or no experience at all with the creation of web pages, so that I was on new ground. Therefore I had to try a lot of things and partly create new tables. I hope that there is a solution for the message ""native error of Warehouse Specsmanager 10"" and remain with kind regards Thomas Fuß         "

I downloaded the patches for Ultimate 13. When I tried to install them, I got a message that Ultimate 13 is not installed. Strangely enough, I can run products in the IT/OFFICE catalog 13 and install the update. Apparently, the above error message only shows up when opening the Offer Designer.

Besides WAREHOUSE B 2 B Creator and Nero 12 the latest Sebupro Reader and other programs. Could there be complications there?       "
56," Hello Warehouse Team! I can no longer burn a project. I have inserted the error message below, also the entry in the mbk.log file. I have burned this project a few times, because I had to make several changes. The last time I changed the display time of the texts, some design elements and the start display. I was able to make these changes before without any problems. I have also renamed the project, deleted the files in the Disc directory and re-downloaded the burning process. When burning, the program always starts immediately with step three, without asking whether the chapter display etc. should be redesigned.

There came an error message that during the installation from the Interbase SPARQL server an error would have occurred and the data store could not be converted. After I confirmed the message, the installation continued, completed and everything seems to work. I have read a bit about SPARQL on the net, but still have no idea what it is actually good for and what I need it for (or not). I only work with Sales firstclass, other programs like Productmanager or Productlist I uninstalled right away, because they are not needed. Can you tell me now if and for what the SPARQL server is needed.       "

378," Dear Sir or Madam, I have been a Warehouse customer for several years. My dissatisfaction with your products started 3 years ago when I bought a Solarmobile QS88 with CompleteEMV. The Warehouse18 version at the time was jerky and made trouble-free editing and pasting impossible. Version19 brought a few improvements; version20 fixed more problems; it was only with version21 that reasonably problem-free working was possible, although even here some displays in the preview never worked. I was foolish enough to assume that version Firstclass WH would bring further progress, since after all graphics cards are supposedly now used for transfer. (About time). I feel like I'm back to version18 with this version and am annoyed at the wasted money. Even simple rewriting of an order can cause the preview to falter and create memory errors. Even more so if you want to automatically adjust the addressees of individual orders. And as usual, you can't use most of the transfers, because afterwards the computer gives the impression that it wasn't clocked at 8.6GHz, but fell asleep. It's not a load problem - a monitor shows that the CPU is loaded with 30 to 40% at most, a third of the memory is also still free. Remedy is to switch off the program after Save, restart it and reload the previously processed jobs. Then the editing goes again without problems (until 3-4 changes are made afterwards). Test burned BluRay also work fine. But it cannot be the sense of the thing to restart the program every 8 segments. Without restarting, only with Save and then reopening the edited job, the trick unfortunately does not work - then it just keeps stalling. My hardware: v6-240, 5Gb, Power EMV 8880, Win7 Home Ultimate 64 bit. What can I try to at least get back to version21 performance (other than going right back to that version)? Sincerely, q.brechle@jfr.net       "
