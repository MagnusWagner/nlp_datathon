Again and again the program terminates for no reason that I can see. Among other things, the program writes:    ""A memory request is invalid. Possibly there is no more memory available, or an internal problem has occurred.""    Furthermore, the program continues to abort with the remark that I should save the current run, and then exit the program,     because the programmm no longer works.

Yesterday I spent several hours only to have to exit and restart the program again.        Furthermore, I noticed with this program that when I wanted to skip several products in the overall view, the program just hangs.    Either it takes a long time until the program reacts, or it writes the ho problems to the screen.      Attached is a screenshot!        What should I do now????????       ",5

How can the error be fixed? Another problem:--------------------- I cannot move the text input fields when creating the control bar screen (in the burn area). Also I can't see the entered text (no matter if set to black, 3,30 or 70%). It was already difficult with the old programs to work reasonably here now in the newest 20+ it is even more difficult! I don't understand why they didn't improve it at this point. Instead, you have to call an additional offer program, which you have to learn again laboriously. At this point the 2006/2007 versions were much easier to handle. You don't want to be constantly annoyed by the program, but you want to work with it sensibly - i.e. most of the functions should be logical and self-explanatory. I have the impression that Warehouse is getting further and further away from this with more and more extensive, complicated programs, especially since the descriptions in the complicated places don't really help.    In the hope for a soon, satisfying answer I remain with friendly greetings       ",5

The installation of the download version of ""Processes in OFFICE Catalog 11"" solved the problem and the order number was included. However, the order numbers are only partially synchronized in the ""Processes in OFFICE Catalog 11"", the ""Download version of Processes in OFFICE Catalog 11"" and the download version of ""Sales first Class 20"". In the initial phase they seem to be synchronous, but in the course of a process this changes. Likewise, I notice that the order numbers immediately become out of sync when the process is edited.

373," Dear Sir or Madam. For years I was a satisfied customer of your products, especially the Sales Firstclass series. But unfortunately I am facing a big problem. In the course of technical development I bought a Complete-EMV data scanner from BPS. As an optimal tool for this, I purchased the download version of Sales Firstclass 19 Neo from Winload. But unfortunately this program does not make me happy. When editing Complete-EMV processes (no matter if in CWVEMX or DATA format) there is an almost permanent CPU overload to 100%, when calculating or displaying the overview there is extreme stalling. If you see my computer equipment, the problems can not be caused by the hardware. The same problem is reported by an acquaintance of mine, who has also used your program for process processing, but is now also desperate. In the meantime I would like to return the software - but Winload refused with the reason that download versions are excluded from a return. So now a last try with your helpdesk. Do you have a tip for me, how to work satisfactorily with Complete-EMV material? (And maybe I will be satisfied again?) With kind regards       ",1
