350," 1st letter dated approx. 7 October Dear Sir or Madam, Yesterday I wanted to convert a process with my CR settlements for the first time. But unfortunately (I tried 4 times) the PC saved only a 50 KB version, although the card contained 30 megabytes and the data could also be seen and read on the PC in the Warehouse program. Where is the error?    Your answer on October 10: Hello Ms. Antje, thank you for contacting us. Please try the following: Click on ""Extensive view"" in the creation dialog. Here, 5208 or 7867 Device should be selected as statistics creation. Please change to any other driver. Now set 5208/7867 Device again. Test if the creation works now. -- Yours sincerely Jens Mälzer My renewed request from 15.12.2011 Dear Mr. Maurer, I am back in Germany after two months of professional travel and finally wanted to start transferring my processes. I tried with your suggestion, but nothing changed, that a process of more than 50 Megabyte with 34 segments is saved as Sales Simple TYT project or as Economy Reader Stats/Sales with 87 segments and of course not displayable. Also the PDF-Readme I can not see what is wrong. As I belong to the working part of the German population, I can't waste my time trying again and again to transfer my processes without seeing any success. I therefore ask for a usable and working instruction what to do and how. Preferably step by step. Sincerely, Anja Antje Unfortunately, you replied that my ticket was already closed and that I should submit a new request. What I do herewith. Source material are older processes, which I have created myself with high quality chip card reader and statements created by the cash register computer. With kind regards Anja Antje       ",4

380," Hi, I'm currently using WSF20Premium and want to upgrade to new hardware before I switch to WSF WH. A few questions about the hardware. What matters most, what brings ""power""? Does a super fast CPU do anything or is a fast hard drive or fast/lots of main memory more important? I have read that certain decryption interfaces bring something with CWVEMX. Then the data is not decrypted by the main CPU, but by the graphics adapter. What is the use of this? I have often had to do rundowns in the past (I work practically only with CWVEMX) and after that the output falters and is no longer displayed ""smoothly"". How is it if you have a system where the graphics card decodes the process data. Does the graphics adapter also perform the rounding correction (more or less rounding places)? If this is of any use, which graphic interfaces must the new computer have for this? In the internet you can read from time to time that this does not bring anything noticeable.

173," I have installed warehouse processes in OFFICE catalog 12 on my new PC running Windows7 (purchased in Feb 11).    1. processes with standard EM cards via EtherNetCard I wanted to transfer from the smart card reader to the PC. This did not work at all - despite seeking advice from the dealer. The message ""No connection to the hardware could be established"" kept appearing, followed by ""The selected folder is write-protected. Saving not possible."" Somehow he didn't know the card reader. Now after 5 months break (miracle of miracles) it suddenly works.    2nd Then I tried to transfer analog cash register lists from process scanner to PC via SD grapper(?). The PC recognized the ARC at ""Hardware"". But also here the above mentioned hint came up all the time. Also this went after some time (without me changing configurations or the like) suddenly and unexpectedly. 3. finally I tried a manual creation. So processes at iProcess or similar directly set, so that I can use them without online access. This only works with the product data it does not create any order number. I have already written the messages under 1. In addition I have separately the old PC usable, which runs under WindowsXP. There I still had the previous version of Warehouse installed. Therefore I installed the new Warehouse also there to test the mentioned three creation variants. All three worked immediately and flawlessly. Therefore I kept on trying on the new PC. But I just can't get the direct creation to work. Could this be due to Windows7 or the system components? And how can I fix this problem?       ",3

379," Good day Warehouse Helpdesk, when I work with the overlay and ved backcalculating setting. Then my process stalls extremely on large input data. When I look at it directly with the process scanner on the screen, there is no stalling at all. I also tried with bed, but the process data is displayed many times. You can imagine that the data is opened and closed one by one. Of course you would have to do this very fast. Without backcalculating there are a lot of empty columns. These were all the settings that the software has available. Now I don't know how I can create my processes without stalling with Warehouse... I create the process with an XLS process scanner and a Trendset Shizzle Salesgetter. I have to say that this error does not occur at all with Trendset's own program. Therefore, it is clearly due to my sales firstclass 20 software. However, I would like to get this error eliminated, because I like sales firstclass better than Trendst shizzle. As I have read in forums, I am not the only one with this error. Are there any updates or workarounds for this rough problem at some point? Thank you Yours sincerely Frank Elster       ",1

516," Addendum to d. already closed ticket#: 1633443022242217: Hello Mr. Krempler,    first of all I wish you happy holidays to have had and all the best and mainly health for the new year !    Unfortunately, I have to contact you again, as I continue to have problems loading the drains at all. I have tried several times to load the driver version according to your explanations. I have a Jiaoda - Notebook N 25 L - storage capacity 2.048 - operating system Windows XP So: - first waited that updates for the protection programs were completed - plugged     the USB - stick without any other extension cables at the back of the notebook ( what function has the button on d. USB - Sick ??? ) - saved the driver version    http://download.warehouse.net/warehouse_usb-prozessverwalter_5_(yellow_white)_en-4.zip     on the desktop. - then    extracted to drive C. - then tried to run setup.exe.     And here the problem begins: I clicked with the right mouse button on the EXE - file,     => execute as selected, but what is meant by administrator ?     here always comes the question : which user account should be used ?     I clicked on current user ( Notebook Hanfke ) + OK.     Then always comes the message: Error saving at the current location.    After a few attempts to download the software I was sure that it worked, there was no error message. Also it was in the list in Control Panel / Add/Remove Programs, so I thought everything is ok now.    - now I tried if I can import a sequence from the data scanner ( Powerread / Mini EM `s ). So data scanner connected with the connection cable see figure 1 ==> question: what is with the left plug ? Now in the program Warehouse Sales firstclass WH the blue button pressed ==> as creation source top right EM - card reader selected. Now came the hint , that no connection to the data scanner is established, even if I set it to scan before. I could only import from the data scanner as a single data record.    - Transferring from XLS - process scanner:    Connected with jack cable, see Figure 3, the import worked after I had pressed the gray button     on the USB stick (I saw the process displayed on the monitor of the Warehouse Sales program). ) - When I wanted to pull the sequence now on the schedulingview, appeared there only 1 data record! So not every single record of the flow.    When pressing billing on this data, the whole imported flow is displayed, but not in individual records.    - I have not tried the transfer from the POS system. It is a brand new system Accountenance Art 75 LED with internal memory    ( bought September 2010 )    Question: is for this the cable see figure 2 ?         The POS system does not have a connection socket for this. Or is it only possible with the jack cables ?    Since I could not import as desired, I have now uninstalled everything after Christmas and again installed the software Warehouse Sales Firstclass WH and wanted to install again via the download the software for the process manager. But now it does not work with the software USB process manager at all. Every attempt failed. I also tried saving it first to my own files and then extracted to the C drive. Finally I get the error message: Error saving One .......    more question: if I want to close the Sales firstclass WH program, i.e. click on the X, it could                              never be closed (the computer always had to be shut down).    I am simply in despair. I just don't have the computer knowledge to see where I might have made what mistake. With your explanation: If there are already drivers on your PC, first select the option Uninstall or Uninstall                                and then start the installation again. I do not get along. I may be removing the wrong programs and creating havoc in my computer.    I did not think that it is so difficult to set up your process program, rather to make the right connection for the transfer. Probably knowledge is assumed here, which I do not have . And the USB - process manager set did not come with a manual either.    I hope that you can help me or explain it to me so exactly step by step, so that I get everything installed correctly.    With kind regards Your desperate    Daniela Hanfke, Bremerhaven----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     ----- Original Message-----      Dear Daniela Hanfke, Thank you for contacting us. Before starting the creation, please remove all USB-connected devices (except mouse and keyboard) that are not necessary during the creation to avoid possible conflicts. Then please use another USB port on your PC for the analog creation. Do not use USB distributors (hubs). Please connect the USB process manager directly to your PC (without USB extension). If you have always used the back inputs of your PC so far, please connect the process manager to a USB interface on the front of your PC for a test.     Please then install the current driver version of your USB process manager from here: http://download.warehouse.net/warehouse_usb-prozessverwalter_5_(rot_weiss)_en-4.zip First download the archive to your PC and unpack / extract the directory completely into a folder on your PC. For the installation, close all running protection programs on your PC (firewall, antivirus software) and then execute the setup.exe from the above directory. The drivers should then be installed. If there are already drivers on your PC, click on the Uninstall option first and then start the installation again. Please run the setup.exe as administrator. To do this, right-click on the EXE file and click on ""Run as "" and then ""Administrator"". If the drivers are installed, please try to create them again using the USB device and your WAREHOUSE program. If the creations are incomplete, please click on the ""Advanced Settings"" button and enable the ""Optimize for older and low performance computers"" option. Then select the option ""User defined"" under ""Creation size"" and remove the specified value under ""Manual calculation correction"" in the window that then appears, so that this can be regenerated for the next creations.

521," Hello everyone I bought a new PC in the hope that it will be better with the calculation. But first the back.... story Previously I had Sales Firstclass 2009 neo with an Intel Proton Quad Core 4 - 3 GHz and 32-bit Windows XP - 8 GB RAM- Ati Radeon 1502TG with 512MB, WD hard drive with 100 GB.  Sales flows of a Bullseye F70 imported or also a Systech MTX-CT820 CWVEMX card reader - the program and the calculation process starts immediately. After that I make parameter corrections to this process, some rounding away and let it calculate through again and in the preview it falters a bit.... ok, after the export it is of course no more.    Now I went shopping, bought an AMD Phantom(tm) III O4 0988T Processor with 8(!) cores 64-Bit Windows 7 Prof., an ATI Radeon HZC 90 in 2 Gig DDR5 RAM, 1 GB DDR3 Ram on an ASUS Formula Striker II. Steam enough that Windows sets the performance index to 7.2, but that's because of the SSH harddisk, the rest is 7.9. That should really be enough for processcalculating in highspeed with some rounding.  Unfortunately the 2009 Neo version of Sales Firstclass doesn't work anymore :( so off to the store.  Now I buy the new Sales Firstclass 20 Ultimate EMV incl. Stylisher B2B add-on version and install it on the SSD hard drive.... everything super fast and it just goes off like there is no tomorrow. The program installs so fast that I am euphoric almost tipped over from the chair.  Now the big test... Load process from the 2009 version... works... Calculate with space bar ... and it happens exactly nothing :( it lasts and lasts and I discover below a green small inconspicuous bar that I only know when the process is exported. I didn't want to export, I just wanted to take a look at the preview ....suddenly the calculation starts... it stalls... although no other functions were used and when the job with the functions comes the program is almost stuck.   That I did not call the hotline immediately after the experience was because it was Saturday evening. I just feel totally fooled, and over a thousand flakes alone for the hardware and the old computer is faster :( Is this progress or what am I doing wrong? Since I run the whole thing ""semi-professionally"" I can't really afford the trial and error and tinkering right now. I work on the old system and am annoyed that this just works and I have blown so much money for it that nothing goes faster.    Where is the fault?`Will AMD cathegorically not supported? Or are 3 GB too slow ? 8 cores a 3 GHz too lame? The memory too lean?  I need help and professional information. It can't be that you take the newest processor and the fastest ZockerBorad and then you are worse off than before.  Oh well, 3dmark runs about 15 times faster than on the old computer. It's true that the computer really runs faster. But SalesFirstclass doesn't work anymore :( Why?  I thank you for the explanations and advice that lead to success :) So that I can get up in the morning with a smile :)  Greetings from CH, Emilio       ",1

414," Dear Sir or Madam, Sales goods that I save from the POS computer to my external hard drive in dat format and then read into Sales FirstClass 20, I can assemble, insert and edit as I wish. The display within the program is also flawless. But: As soon as I save the project (as a file - regardless of the format - or burn it to DVD) the identity between data and order number is no longer correct. The order number slips (about 4/5 fields). Within the first dat-file everything is still ok, with all following, attached and connected dat-files (i.e. in the course of the process the distance becomes larger and larger) the distance adds up. Could you give me an explanation/help for this? Unfortunately I did not find anything in the forum.       ",3
391," My program is: Salesfirstclass2010 ultimate (7.8.6.4) - import EMV- process data recorded with a CWVEMX card reader and converted to DAT. - Process (DAT files) edited as usual (element deleted or added, products (wdt) added, some sales processes inserted from a DVD copied to the hard disk -BRG...sop-) - During the burning attempt, after 75% of the encoding has been done according to the progress indicator, the following messages appear: ""Memory request invalid"" and ""Error encoding. No files could be found"". I did not move any files; all are in their original folders. - As an alternative attempt, I saved the flow under a different name and removed all the inserted products as well as the inserted BRG* .sop files. Thus, only the files read in with the card reader and converted to DAT were left in the sequence. But even here, the messages ""A save request is invalid"" appeared during the burn attempt. ""An internal problem has occurred"" and finally ""Encrypt invalid"". - On a trial basis, I also edited the sequence in a test version of Trendset Studio 17. Here the burning occurred smoothly. But I DO NOT WANT TO USE ANOTHER EDITING SOFTWARE AS WAREHOUSE. - Along the way, I also edited and burned other workflows that were captured via the built-in EC data scanner. Worked all smoothly. One more question, I am toying with the latest version of SfC but not sure if my system is sufficient. Can you let me know if SfC 19 will run on my system? In particular, in combination with my EC card, the integrated data scanner should also work. Thank you in advance for your help.       ",5
416," Dear Sir or Madam, I have a problem when applying scripts. As soon as I insert them and look at the process or the order again, the order number does not match the data and at the end of this order the beginning of the order is mapped hanging for a few process steps. I have DATA files. Thanks already for an answer. MFG       ",3
541," Burning after DirectEditing Processing etc. runs normally until the message ""Disc is being burned"". Then there is an abort with ""Internal problem during execution"" and an additional note ""No access rights to the drive. Possibly it is locked by another application"".    What can be done here? After DirectEditing, if I only change the flow display, then the burning works. I had this problem before with the NEO2009 version from time to time, but after several aborts it always worked again. I have uninstalled the NEO2009 version in the meantime. Do the two program versions actually bite each other, if one both installed laesst?        ",2

Dear ladies and gentlemen, if you bring immature software on the market and I have to start as a layman analyses with you to coordinate so I miss further desire to work with your software.
