 hello i currently use the trial version of sales firstclass  neo dvd version i ordered  yesterday i wanted to burn a dvd x  in all cases there was a crash when creating the disk image file  am already very disappointed in the new program  i error message problem in class wmembank  dll i i load addressxf at address xefcre i i exception xc access forbidden i i sent the error log to warehouse  how can the error be fixed  another problem i cannot move the text input fields when creating the control bar screen in the burn area  also i cant see the entered text no matter if set to black     or   it was already difficult with the old programs to work reasonably here now in the newest  it is even more difficult  i dont understand why they didnt improve it at this point  instead  you have to call an additional offer program  which you have to learn again laboriously  at this point the  versions were much easier to handle  you dont want to be constantly annoyed by the program  but you want to work with it sensibly  i  e  most of the functions should be logical and selfexplanatory  i have the impression that warehouse is getting further and further away from this with more and more extensive  complicated programs  especially since the descriptions in the complicated places dont really help  in the hope for a soon  satisfying answer i remain with friendly greetings ,5

 i followed all instructions folder files etc  the  dll file did not exist anymore   by the way again and reinstalled everything  no chance  always the same problem code      the upgrade option i would have actually gladly used  but there i come as you know with this error not at all  because the program crashes when running each time for your information      a patch i could not download until just now  despite registration of the serial number was there nothing displayed for sc   now just now suddenly a new   patch was to be seen     everything very very strangely with your enterprise must i say with the present firm policy i am not at all content as a customer      why is always only the current patch displayed at most  always only for registered software  yes i know  the evil pirate copiers  me as a paying customer so far you drive with your constantly      faulty software soon the pirate copiers in the arms instead     of gngelung of their own customers should warehouse times rethink and reward their own customers at least with flawless software     downloaded the patch in the meantime and hopefully executed its installation even afterwards directly from the program folder of the already installed sc ultimate  then  however  came the next joke    about it already much in the internet discussed that this ominous problem code  error actually a copy protection thing of your company is     stupid however  if one installs yes from the original cd and then such an error gets     i attached     you the newest joke times as gif i have no idea what your company has programmed there with the sc  ultimate  but a problemfree to install and running software it is definitely not     i am now approx   years in the business  but you are just really about to conquer the top place in the program history of the worst software     and now please do not tell me to uninstall all even previously normal running warehouse programs before installing sc and  or close firewall  antivirus software etc  pp      where are we  something like that in this day and age  and at the same time warehouse requires to be online all the time     you have here a simple statistics     program no officesuite or super game etc     and all these you just install on the side while you surf the internet or chat while still listening to     music and everything runs immediately and quite smoothly    and if not  then it is fixed     with an update the division problem from sc you have not been able to fix there until today     im really curious about the actual solution of the current sc error now like a bow     hopefully i experience the solution again and do not get a stroke before and another spoiled weekend by warehouse     kind regards ,1
