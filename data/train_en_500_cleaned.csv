" addendum to d  already closed ticket    hello mr  krempler  first of all i wish you happy holidays to have had and all the best and mainly health for the new year  unfortunately  i have to contact you again  as i continue to have problems loading the drains at all  i have tried several times to load the driver version according to your explanations  i have a jiaoda  notebook n  l  storage capacity     operating system windows xp so  first waited that updates for the protection programs were completed  plugged the usb  stick without any other extension cables at the back of the notebook  what function has the button on d  usb  sick      saved the driver version on the desktop   then extracted to drive c   then tried to run setup  exe  and here the problem begins i clicked with the right mouse button on the exe  file   execute as selected  but what is meant by administrator  here always comes the question  which user account should be used  i clicked on current user  notebook hanfke   ok  then always comes the message error saving at the current location  after a few attempts to download the software i was sure that it worked  there was no error message  also it was in the list in control panel  addremove programs  so i thought everything is ok now   now i tried if i can import a sequence from the data scanner  powerread  mini em s   so data scanner connected with the connection cable see figure   question what is with the left plug  now in the program warehouse sales firstclass wh the blue button pressed  as creation source top right em  card reader selected  now came the hint  that no connection to the data scanner is established  even if i set it to scan before  i could only import from the data scanner as a single data record   transferring from xls  process scanner connected with jack cable  see figure   the import worked after i had pressed the gray button on the usb stick i saw the process displayed on the monitor of the warehouse sales program    when i wanted to pull the sequence now on the schedulingview  appeared there only  data record  so not every single record of the flow  when pressing billing on this data  the whole imported flow is displayed  but not in individual records   i have not tried the transfer from the pos system  it is a brand new system accountenance art  led with internal memory  bought september   question is for this the cable see figure   the pos system does not have a connection socket for this  or is it only possible with the jack cables  since i could not import as desired  i have now uninstalled everything after christmas and again installed the software warehouse sales firstclass wh and wanted to install again via the download the software for the process manager  but now it does not work with the software usb process manager at all  every attempt failed  i also tried saving it first to my own files and then extracted to the c drive  finally i get the error message error saving one        more question if i want to close the sales firstclass wh program  i  e  click on the x  it could never be closed the computer always had to be shut down  i am simply in despair  i just dont have the computer knowledge to see where i might have made what mistake  with your explanation if there are already drivers on your pc  first select the option uninstall or uninstall and then start the installation again  i do not get along  i may be removing the wrong programs and creating havoc in my computer  i did not think that it is so difficult to set up your process program  rather to make the right connection for the transfer  probably knowledge is assumed here  which i do not have  and the usb  process manager set did not come with a manual either  i hope that you can help me or explain it to me so exactly step by step  so that i get everything installed correctly  with kind regards your desperate daniela hanfke  bremerhaven  original message dear daniela hanfke  thank you for contacting us  before starting the creation  please remove all usbconnected devices except mouse and keyboard that are not necessary during the creation to avoid possible conflicts  then please use another usb port on your pc for the analog creation  do not use usb distributors hubs  please connect the usb process manager directly to your pc without usb extension  if you have always used the back inputs of your pc so far  please connect the process manager to a usb interface on the front of your pc for a test  please then install the current driver version of your usb process manager from here first download the archive to your pc and unpack  extract the directory completely into a folder on your pc  for the installation  close all running protection programs on your pc firewall  antivirus software and then execute the setup  exe from the above directory  the drivers should then be installed  if there are already drivers on your pc  click on the uninstall option first and then start the installation again  please run the setup  exe as administrator  to do this  rightclick on the exe file and click on run as and then administrator  if the drivers are installed  please try to create them again using the usb device and your warehouse program  if the creations are incomplete  please click on the advanced settings button and enable the optimize for older and low performance computers option  then select the option user defined under creation size and remove the specified value under manual calculation correction in the window that then appears  so that this can be

" hello everyone i bought a new pc in the hope that it will be better with the calculation  but first the back     story previously i had sales firstclass  neo with an intel proton quad core    ghz and bit windows xp   gb ram ati radeon tg with mb  wd hard drive with  gb  sales flows of a bullseye f imported or also a systech mtxct cwvemx card reader  the program and the calculation process starts immediately  after that i make parameter corrections to this process  some rounding away and let it calculate through again and in the preview it falters a bit     ok  after the export it is of course no more  now i went shopping  bought an amd phantomtm iii o t processor with    cores bit windows  prof   an ati radeon hzc  in  gig ddr ram   gb ddr ram on an asus formula striker ii  steam enough that windows sets the performance index to     but thats because of the ssh harddisk  the rest is     that should really be enough for processcalculating in highspeed with some rounding  unfortunately the  neo version of sales firstclass doesnt work anymore  so off to the store  now i buy the new sales firstclass  ultimate emv incl  stylisher bb addon version and install it on the ssd hard drive     everything super fast and it just goes off like there is no tomorrow  the program installs so fast that i am euphoric almost tipped over from the chair  now the big test    load process from the  version    works    calculate with space bar    and it happens exactly nothing  it lasts and lasts and i discover below a green small inconspicuous bar that i only know when the process is exported  i didnt want to export  i just wanted to take a look at the preview     suddenly the calculation starts    it stalls    although no other functions were used and when the job with the functions comes the program is almost stuck  that i did not call the hotline immediately after the experience was because it was saturday evening  i just feel totally fooled  and over a thousand flakes alone for the hardware and the old computer is faster  is this progress or what am i doing wrong  since i run the whole thing semiprofessionally i cant really afford the trial and error and tinkering right now  i work on the old system and am annoyed that this just works and i have blown so much money for it that nothing goes faster  where is the fault  will amd cathegorically not supported  or are  gb too slow   cores a  ghz too lame  the memory too lean  i need help and professional information  it cant be that you take the newest processor and the fastest zockerborad and then you are worse off than before  oh well  dmark runs about  times faster than on the old computer  its true that the computer really runs faster  but salesfirstclass doesnt work anymore  why  i thank you for the explanations and advice that lead to success  so that i can get up in the morning with a smile  greetings from ch  emilio ","1"
