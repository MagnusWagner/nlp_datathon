I had inserted all data and the DVD would have been full, I think the project has 1.6 GB. Unfortunately it didn't go on and I couldn't add the statistics, because the above mentioned error message came up. So I downloaded the test version 12 and finished the project with products in the IT & OFFICE catalog 12. Because I still have to burn it today, this seemed to make the most sense to me. Now I've been messing around with the project all weekend. With the 11er the same error message came at the end. Since the 12 is the test version, I can't burn with it, of course. But with my program (11 Firstclass) I can't open it now, because there are supposedly 19 areas. In no case I make the entire project again! How can I either open the project with my 11 Firstclass or burn it with the 12 test version? Thank you for your quick reply.       ",5

Furthermore, with increasing use I had more and more problems or failures of your program: 1.the insert etc. - processing could be opened, but showed nothing more and was accordingly no longer usable. 2. with new XLS conversions always the SPARQL data memory announced itself with a long error message - obviously the appropriate data memory is defective, since I could not successfully search also over the statistic tables converted afterwards any longer for categories - I could proceed only after the folder logic - which was very important to me however.

If I want to edit a process created with ""WinCASH-BHD 312Y"" with ""Warehouse processes in OFFICE catalog 11"", there is no synchronization between data and order number when billing the process. The order number is behind the order number display with 4 to 5 fields and more.
