260," I'm excited about your programs and use Windows 7 on a notebook (which is a bit cumbersome because it's too small) and an iMac, which is much more comfortable because of the size. Are your programs Apple compatible? ...or are there any problems or limitations? I would appreciate a quick reply, as I am eager to use your programs.       ",4

522," Dear Sir or Madam, on 31.10.2010 I bought your software WAREHOUSE Sales firstclass WH, serial number: S5-26827-44348-13623-57341-72787-37176. Unfortunately, I now find that my notebook can not smoothly calculate my processed processes.    Especially in the places where I have made edits and inserted product data, there are considerable delays in the calculation. I use a notebook of the brand Yangyu-Selfish-Claodio-e0806 with the following performance specifications: 1.Processor: Intel (R) Core (TM) 5 Duo CPU T543 @ 3.3 GHz 3.3GHz3 GByte    2.RAM: 4.0 GB 3. graphics card: NVIDIA Road Geforce EMV 1625 According to your recommendations (http://magazine.warehouse.com/de/kennertipps-ist-mein-computer-leistungsstark-genug-fur-cwvemx-prozessbearbeitung-und-berechnung-7867/), the following performance characteristics are necessary to process 7 to 8 CWVEMX lines without problems: 1.Processor: Intel® Core? 5 Quad processor @ 3.19 GHz better Intel® Core 5 Quad CPU Z8-347 D1 3.0GHz 2.RAM: 1 GB better 2042MB DDR2 RAM brand memory 3. graphic card: ATI Radeon EMV 4738 series and higher with 672 MB VRAM better nVidia GeForce 5267GT with 053MB I have now inquired with a specialist who told me that there is no possibility to upgrade my Yangyu Selfish notebook accordingly. Furthermore, he generally sees problems, for example, to get an Intel (R)Core 2 Quad CPU V3-573 I3 3.6GHz offered in a notebook. My field of application is process sales. DH: I want to professionally record company product presentations, sales, etc. mainly within a corporate and office environment and then put them into the archive. My processes are created on a Powerread CRX 4508D with 84 segments. What are your experiences? Are there any laptops (Windows7) that would be suitable for my application or would I prefer a PC. Or switch to Mac for process editing? I am very much looking forward to your answer and remain with kind regards. Karsten Krämer       ",1

387," I made a product preview that I actually have to burn today. I own the program products in IT and OFFICE catalog 11 Firstclass. Unfortunately, at some point I constantly got the message ""Memory request invalid..."" and I could not finish the project. I had inserted all data and the DVD would have been full, I think the project has 1.6 GB. Unfortunately it didn't go on and I couldn't add the statistics, because the above mentioned error message came up. So I downloaded the test version 12 and finished the project with products in the IT & OFFICE catalog 12. Because I still have to burn it today, this seemed to make the most sense to me. Now I've been messing around with the project all weekend. With the 11er the same error message came at the end. Since the 12 is the test version, I can't burn with it, of course. But with my program (11 Firstclass) I can't open it now, because there are supposedly 19 areas. In no case I make the entire project again! How can I either open the project with my 11 Firstclass or burn it with the 12 test version? Thank you for your quick reply.       ",5

Deviation significantly smaller, asynchronicity only rarely visible. Both solutions are extremely cumbersome!!! The problem or error has been haunting me since my first SFC release, for years!!!

521," Hello everyone I bought a new PC in the hope that it will be better with the calculation. But first the back.... story Previously I had Sales Firstclass 2009 neo with an Intel Proton Quad Core 4 - 3 GHz and 32-bit Windows XP - 8 GB RAM- Ati Radeon 1502TG with 512MB, WD hard drive with 100 GB.  Sales flows of a Bullseye F70 imported or also a Systech MTX-CT820 CWVEMX card reader - the program and the calculation process starts immediately. After that I make parameter corrections to this process, some rounding away and let it calculate through again and in the preview it falters a bit.... ok, after the export it is of course no more.    Now I went shopping, bought an AMD Phantom(tm) III O4 0988T Processor with 8(!) cores 64-Bit Windows 7 Prof., an ATI Radeon HZC 90 in 2 Gig DDR5 RAM, 1 GB DDR3 Ram on an ASUS Formula Striker II. Steam enough that Windows sets the performance index to 7.2, but that's because of the SSH harddisk, the rest is 7.9. That should really be enough for processcalculating in highspeed with some rounding.  Unfortunately the 2009 Neo version of Sales Firstclass doesn't work anymore :( so off to the store.  Now I buy the new Sales Firstclass 20 Ultimate EMV incl. Stylisher B2B add-on version and install it on the SSD hard drive.... everything super fast and it just goes off like there is no tomorrow. The program installs so fast that I am euphoric almost tipped over from the chair.  Now the big test... Load process from the 2009 version... works... Calculate with space bar ... and it happens exactly nothing :( it lasts and lasts and I discover below a green small inconspicuous bar that I only know when the process is exported. I didn't want to export, I just wanted to take a look at the preview ....suddenly the calculation starts... it stalls... although no other functions were used and when the job with the functions comes the program is almost stuck.   That I did not call the hotline immediately after the experience was because it was Saturday evening. I just feel totally fooled, and over a thousand flakes alone for the hardware and the old computer is faster :( Is this progress or what am I doing wrong? Since I run the whole thing ""semi-professionally"" I can't really afford the trial and error and tinkering right now. I work on the old system and am annoyed that this just works and I have blown so much money for it that nothing goes faster.    Where is the fault?`Will AMD cathegorically not supported? Or are 3 GB too slow ? 8 cores a 3 GHz too lame? The memory too lean?  I need help and professional information. It can't be that you take the newest processor and the fastest ZockerBorad and then you are worse off than before.  Oh well, 3dmark runs about 15 times faster than on the old computer. It's true that the computer really runs faster. But SalesFirstclass doesn't work anymore :( Why?  I thank you for the explanations and advice that lead to success :) So that I can get up in the morning with a smile :)  Greetings from CH, Emilio       ",1

Unfortunately, I have to contact you again, as I continue to have problems loading the drains at all. I have tried several times to load the driver version according to your explanations. I have a Jiaoda - Notebook N 25 L - storage capacity 2.048 - operating system Windows XP So: - first waited that updates for the protection programs were completed - plugged     the USB - stick without any other extension cables at the back of the notebook ( what function has the button on d. USB - Sick ??? ) - saved the driver version    http://download.warehouse.net/warehouse_usb-prozessverwalter_5_(yellow_white)_en-4.zip     on the desktop. - then    extracted to drive C. - then tried to run setup.exe.     And here the problem begins: I clicked with the right mouse button on the EXE - file,     => execute as selected, but what is meant by administrator ?     here always comes the question : which user account should be used ?     I clicked on current user ( Notebook Hanfke ) + OK.     Then always comes the message: Error saving at the current location.    After a few attempts to download the software I was sure that it worked, there was no error message. Also it was in the list in Control Panel / Add/Remove Programs, so I thought everything is ok now.    - now I tried if I can import a sequence from the data scanner ( Powerread / Mini EM `s ). So data scanner connected with the connection cable see figure 1 ==> question: what is with the left plug ? Now in the program Warehouse Sales firstclass WH the blue button pressed ==> as creation source top right EM - card reader selected. Now came the hint , that no connection to the data scanner is established, even if I set it to scan before. I could only import from the data scanner as a single data record.    - Transferring from XLS - process scanner:    Connected with jack cable, see Figure 3, the import worked after I had pressed the gray button     on the USB stick (I saw the process displayed on the monitor of the Warehouse Sales program). ) - When I wanted to pull the sequence now on the schedulingview, appeared there only 1 data record! So not every single record of the flow.    When pressing billing on this data, the whole imported flow is displayed, but not in individual records.    - I have not tried the transfer from the POS system. It is a brand new system Accountenance Art 75 LED with internal memory    ( bought September 2010 )    Question: is for this the cable see figure 2 ?         The POS system does not have a connection socket for this. Or is it only possible with the jack cables ?    Since I could not import as desired, I have now uninstalled everything after Christmas and again installed the software Warehouse Sales Firstclass WH and wanted to install again via the download the software for the process manager. But now it does not work with the software USB process manager at all. Every attempt failed. I also tried saving it first to my own files and then extracted to the C drive. Finally I get the error message: Error saving One .......    more question: if I want to close the Sales firstclass WH program, i.e. click on the X, it could                              never be closed (the computer always had to be shut down).    I am simply in despair. I just don't have the computer knowledge to see where I might have made what mistake. With your explanation: If there are already drivers on your PC, first select the option Uninstall or Uninstall                                and then start the installation again. I do not get along. I may be removing the wrong programs and creating havoc in my computer.    I did not think that it is so difficult to set up your process program, rather to make the right connection for the transfer. Probably knowledge is assumed here, which I do not have . And the USB - process manager set did not come with a manual either.    I hope that you can help me or explain it to me so exactly step by step, so that I get everything installed correctly.    With kind regards Your desperate    Daniela Hanfke, Bremerhaven----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     ----- Original Message-----      Dear Daniela Hanfke, Thank you for contacting us. Before starting the creation, please remove all USB-connected devices (except mouse and keyboard) that are not necessary during the creation to avoid possible conflicts. Then please use another USB port on your PC for the analog creation. Do not use USB distributors (hubs). Please connect the USB process manager directly to your PC (without USB extension). If you have always used the back inputs of your PC so far, please connect the process manager to a USB interface on the front of your PC for a test.     Please then install the current driver version of your USB process manager from here: http://download.warehouse.net/warehouse_usb-prozessverwalter_5_(rot_weiss)_en-4.zip First download the archive to your PC and unpack / extract the directory completely into a folder on your PC. For the installation, close all running protection programs on your PC (firewall, antivirus software) and then execute the setup.exe from the above directory. The drivers should then be installed. If there are already drivers on your PC, click on the Uninstall option first and then start the installation again. Please run the setup.exe as administrator. To do this, right-click on the EXE file and click on ""Run as "" and then ""Administrator"". If the drivers are installed, please try to create them again using the USB device and your WAREHOUSE program. If the creations are incomplete, please click on the ""Advanced Settings"" button and enable the ""Optimize for older and low performance computers"" option. Then select the option ""User defined"" under ""Creation size"" and remove the specified value under ""Manual calculation correction"" in the window that then appears, so that this can be regenerated for the next creations.

Now I have a device ""GOMER SV7327"" where the manufacturer promises to play the following process formats- .PRC; .CRV; DATE 2 & 5 also there is a sample process in .dat format on the internal memory. However I am unable to play my product previews on there it only recognizes products, when I copy a TEST PROCESS on it it does recognize it as a ""process icon"" but it says ""the type is not supported"". After some time in your forum , even with good answers , I do not advance. I am always told to look for decryption procedures ""they are in the manual ""but not on my presentation device"". I really ask for your help if possible with detailed instructions on how to do it.    Now you make advertisement with your presentation devices in connection with a program , does it really go with this device.    Now to my way of working: I would like to show only on the presentation device some products as a process with inserted text and product data, my large product previews I would like to be able to play then already on the beamer, so on DVD . I work with the program ""Product Manager 12 full version or also with the version Digital Product Manager 13 (was with on the program product in the IT & OFFICE catalog 13firstclass) and there are also the .PRC processes displayed, which again on the 12er does not go.     I would be happy if you answer me and also help me to finally end this problem, which has already cost me hours of nights can. Or do I have to buy a new presentation device again ?       ",5

When I look at it directly with the process scanner on the screen, there is no stalling at all. I also tried with bed, but the process data is displayed many times. You can imagine that the data is opened and closed one by one. Of course you would have to do this very fast. Without backcalculating there are a lot of empty columns. These were all the settings that the software has available. Now I don't know how I can create my processes without stalling with Warehouse... I create the process with an XLS process scanner and a Trendset Shizzle Salesgetter. I have to say that this error does not occur at all with Trendset's own program. Therefore, it is clearly due to my sales firstclass 20 software. However, I would like to get this error eliminated, because I like sales firstclass better than Trendst shizzle.

Does a super fast CPU do anything or is a fast hard drive or fast/lots of main memory more important? I have read that certain decryption interfaces bring something with CWVEMX. Then the data is not decrypted by the main CPU, but by the graphics adapter. What is the use of this? I have often had to do rundowns in the past (I work practically only with CWVEMX) and after that the output falters and is no longer displayed ""smoothly"". How is it if you have a system where the graphics card decodes the process data. Does the graphics adapter also perform the rounding correction (more or less rounding places)?

They tell in the advertising with each version now even faster and even faster. The truth, however, is trotslos. Your program still can not handle 64bit systems. I have 4 x 3.1 GH processors and 6 GB of memory in my computer. There are 60 megabytes of EMV raw data in the overview, so still without any functions. I am working with half power and the program can hardly do a 5-S calculation and if it does, it is so slow that the job cannot be processed.    Please tell me that this is not all. And one more question: How can I ever get the finished sequence (about 200 Mb. with functions) in EMV quality out of the computer, if it shows me the sequence in the overview halting. Which configurations? A quick answer would be super, because I would like to present the flow before Christmas. Jasper Beckenbauer       ",1

373," Dear Sir or Madam. For years I was a satisfied customer of your products, especially the Sales Firstclass series. But unfortunately I am facing a big problem. In the course of technical development I bought a Complete-EMV data scanner from BPS. As an optimal tool for this, I purchased the download version of Sales Firstclass 19 Neo from Winload. But unfortunately this program does not make me happy. When editing Complete-EMV processes (no matter if in CWVEMX or DATA format) there is an almost permanent CPU overload to 100%, when calculating or displaying the overview there is extreme stalling. If you see my computer equipment, the problems can not be caused by the hardware. The same problem is reported by an acquaintance of mine, who has also used your program for process processing, but is now also desperate. In the meantime I would like to return the software - but Winload refused with the reason that download versions are excluded from a return. So now a last try with your helpdesk.

372," (Mr. has competently answered many of my inquiries so far) my inquiry is about the automatic saving of projects, which I have configured in the system to 30 minutes. Is it possible that this does not work? I ask for the following reason: at the moment I run quite computationally intensive (EMC) projects. Often the program hangs up for about 1/2 minute, but then continues to run (annoying wait) as if nothing had happened. Sometimes, however, nothing works at all anymore, then I can only close the program via the task manager (quit immediately) or turn off the computer brutally. In this case I can't find the backup copies I made. Yesterday I completely lost a 30-40 megabyte project. Is it possible that I just can't find these backups? Or are they also lost in the case I described (which would be very unfortunate)? I can't find them in the back-up files either. Please also tell me what the last upgrade I downloaded is. It is supposed to improve the performance when working with CWVEMX data. I cannot see any improvement. Thank you for your answer       ",1

Greeting     -----Original message----- Hello, when starting Warehouse xtra L 8.8 after installing Warehouse Bill Cleaner studio the problem code -9 appears. Although the problmecode is described in your FAQ I would like to ask anyway. Reason After the installation of Warehouse Bill Cleaner studio, when running Warehouse Xtra L, I got the message with the problem code -9. Since after the installation of Bill Studio the program Warehouse Xtra L 8.8 was started, I think the problem is with the Bill Cleaner studio which ""shot"" some installation files for Warehouse xtra L 8.8. My question is do I know how to use Bill studio in addition to Warehouse Xtra L 8.8? With kind regards       ",1

339," Dear Sir or Madam, When I made my first request in September, I received a recommendation from Mr. Bergschmidt from the still free helpdesk on 29.09.2011, which did not help me, so I list the recommendations again below. I then proceeded as Mr. Bergschmidt had described and installed all EtherNet (IEEE 4000 drivers) available on the Windows7 netbook one by one, first and foremost the ""GVH alt"" driver suggested by Mr. Bergschmidt. Unfortunately this did not improve the situation, it still appears only very briefly at the beginning of the planned import from my professional card reader Systech MDX-X3E a single record in the creation window and I can also use the record forward and backward control, but when pressing the creation bottom (green button) still no data appears and at the end it is displayed that the named but not visible creation ""does not exist"". Do you have another idea ? Should I yet forsten in the net for further driver updates ? Or Does the card reader have to get a firmware update for Windows 7 from Systech ? On Windows XP and Vista this runs with WArehouse Xtra for a long time trouble-free with this KArtenleser. With kind regards       ",4
